Vizzuality Soybean Code Challenge

This is the repository for the Vizzuality Coding Challenge dealing with soybean production data.
Please see the following for more info: <https://github.com/Vizzuality/science-code-challenge/blob/main/README.md>

To view the python notebook with the interactive elements restored, please go to:
<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kozmanaut/vizz_code/blob/main/Vizzuality_coding_challenge.ipynb?flush_cache=false>

However, nbviewer does seem to act up and does not show the most updated version of the notebook. So please check the code here directly as well!
